HR Simple Shell

This is a simple PHP based WebShell I made...

It is a work in progress and a bit of a frankenstein at the moment. It is stable and working but I have lots of updates planned just havent gotten around to yet. Source is well commented for anyone interested in checking it out. 

Features:
	- Hidden 404 login page
		- Default Pass: Sup3rS3cr3t
